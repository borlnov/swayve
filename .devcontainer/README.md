# Devcontainer & Claude Code

The dev container builds from [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile): a recent git built from source, the
GitHub CLI (`gh`), the Flutter SDK (pinned to the version the ACT packages this app depends on
expect), the Android SDK and a JDK (Swayve is an Android-first app — it reads the phone's inertial
sensors), the Linux desktop build toolchain (GTK3, clang, lld…) for fast iteration and tests, the
native SQLite library `flutter test` needs, and [reuse](https://reuse.software/) for license
linting. The [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI is installed at container creation
(see below).

There are **no devcontainer features**: every tool is installed directly in the image, which keeps
versions explicit and the build reproducible. In particular there is no Node.js runtime — nothing here
needs one.

It is **Docker Compose based** ([`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml), service `dev`). The old
`runArgs` / `workspaceMount` / `build` keys are gone — Compose ignores them — so host networking, the
X11 socket, the workspace mount and the config volumes all live in the compose service now.
`devcontainer.json` just points at it. The clone is mounted at `/workspaces/swayve`, which is the
single source of truth `workspaceFolder` owns and everything else derives from (`WORKSPACE_DIR` via
`${containerWorkspaceFolder}`); the mount target in `docker-compose.yml` is the one copy that has to
be kept in sync by hand, and the two files cross-reference each other.

## Git worktrees

Worktrees live in the gitignored [`worktrees/`](../worktrees/README.md) directory at the repository
root, so no extra mount or configuration is involved. A recent git makes it work:
`worktree.useRelativePaths` (set on the system config by `postCreateCommand`) makes a worktree's
links relative, so they resolve both inside the container and on the host, whose clone path is
different. It needs git >= 2.48 and Debian trixie ships 2.47, which is why the Dockerfile builds git
from source into `/usr/local`.

## Claude Code install & auth

Claude Code is installed by `postCreateCommand` with the official installer
(`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash -s latest`), which fetches a self-contained native
binary — no Node.js runtime is involved. It runs as the unprivileged container user because
everything lands under `$HOME`:

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.local/bin/claude` | launcher (put on `PATH` by the Dockerfile) |
| `~/.local/share/claude/` | versioned binaries, and the self-update target |
| `~/.claude/` | config, credentials, sessions — the named volume, see below |

Because the binary lives outside `~/.claude`, the volume mounted there does not shadow it, and Claude
owns its own install directory and can self-update normally.

It is installed at container creation rather than baked into the image on purpose. Each version is
around 250MB, and the CLI keeps self-updating to new ones; in the container's writable layer the CLI's
own cleanup can reclaim the old ones, whereas an image layer would pin the original copy forever. It
also means the install sees `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (a runtime-only setting), so its state file goes into
the config dir instead of beside it. The trade-off is that creating the container takes about half a
minute longer and needs network access; a failure there is reported by VS Code and leaves the rest of
the environment usable — rerun the command by hand to recover.

**Authentication is interactive — run `claude` once and sign in through the wizard.** There is no
token to mint or paste; everything else (Flutter, reuse) works regardless of whether you've signed
in.

The login persists, so **you only do this once**. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (set in `devcontainer.json`)
points Claude's entire config — both the `~/.claude` data dir and `~/.claude.json`, which holds the
credentials, onboarding and trusted-folder state — at an **isolated named Docker volume**
(`swayve-claude-config`, declared in [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml)). A named volume, not
a host bind mount: Claude's plugin index stores **absolute in-container paths**, so sharing the host
`~/.claude` would leak them across containers (a sibling devcontainer then breaks with `Source path
does not exist: /home/...`). The volume persists across rebuilds and **starts empty** — the image
pre-creates `~/.claude` so the fresh volume is owned by the container user, and on the first build you
sign in (and re-add any plugin marketplaces) once.

## GitHub CLI (gh) auth

`gh` comes from GitHub's own apt repository rather than Debian's, whose package trails upstream by
years. Like Claude Code, **it is signed into from inside the container — run `gh auth login` once**.
No token has to be minted, pasted or stored in a file: the browser flow prints a one-time code and a
URL you open on the host, so it works even though the container has no browser of its own.

The login persists, so **you only do this once**. `gh` writes its credentials to `hosts.yml` in the
directory `GH_CONFIG_DIR` points at (`devcontainer.json`), which is an isolated named Docker volume
(`swayve-gh-config`, declared in [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml)) — the same arrangement
as Claude Code above, for the same reason: it survives rebuilds and is shared with nothing, so a
container never depends on how the host happens to store its own GitHub login.

Two answers to give the wizard:

- **Preferred protocol for git operations: SSH.** Git authenticates through the host `~/.ssh`, which
  is bind-mounted into the container.
- **"Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?": no.** For the same reason — and the credential
  helper it would install goes into `~/.gitconfig`, which is not persisted.

The container carries no SSH key of its own, so pushing over the `git@github.com:` remote does not
work from inside it; push over HTTPS with the `gh` credential helper instead:

```bash
git -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' \
  push https://github.com/borlnov/swayve.git <branch>
```

`gh` also reads a token from `GH_TOKEN` if one is exported, which is useful for headless or CI
invocations. Be aware that it takes precedence over the stored login and that `gh auth login` then
refuses to store credentials at all, so keep it to the command or shell that needs it — the container
deliberately does not set it.

## Running the Flutter app's GUI

The container forwards the X11 socket and `DISPLAY` so `flutter run -d linux` can open a window on
the host's X server. This requires an X11 (or XWayland) display reachable from the container — no
extra setup is needed on a typical Linux desktop; on WSL, make sure an X server (e.g. WSLg, which
ships by default on recent Windows 11) is running.

## Building and running on Android

Swayve reads the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope, so a real device is the primary target. The
image carries the Android SDK (command-line tools, `platform-tools`, `platforms;android-36`,
`build-tools;36.0.0`) and a JDK, wired to Flutter, so `flutter build appbundle` / `flutter build
apk` and `flutter doctor`'s Android toolchain work inside the container without any host setup —
`flutter doctor` should show `[✓] Android toolchain`.

To run and debug on a real phone, use **wireless adb** rather than USB: passing a USB device into a
container on WSL needs `usbipd` and extra privileges, whereas wireless adb only needs the phone and
the machine on the same network, which the container already reaches through its default outbound
networking.

1. On the phone, enable **Developer options → Wireless debugging**.
2. Pair once (Android 11+): tap **Pair device with pairing code** — it shows an `IP:port` and a
   six-digit code — then in the container run `adb pair <ip>:<pair-port>` and enter the code.
3. Connect: `adb connect <ip>:<port>`, using the IP and port from the Wireless debugging screen
   itself (a different port from the pairing one).
4. `flutter devices` now lists the phone; run it with `flutter run -d <device-id>` (or pick it in
   VS Code's device selector).

On WSL the container reaches the phone's LAN address through the default NAT, so no `--network=host`
or USB passthrough is needed. If `adb connect` cannot reach the phone, check that its IP is
reachable from WSL (the two share the LAN through the Windows host) and that no firewall blocks the
adb port.

## First run

1. Open the folder in VS Code and reopen in the container (or run
   `docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml up -d` manually).
2. Run `claude` once and sign in, and `gh auth login` once.
3. `postCreateCommand` already ran `flutter pub get` (and any other dependency install that applies
   at the repo's current state — see `devcontainer.json`); if you add a submodule or package later,
   rebuild or re-run the relevant command by hand.
4. `flutter run -d linux` (fast desktop iteration) or `flutter run -d <android-device>` to launch the
   app.
